  OpenRouter is an API platform that provides unified access to multiple AI
  language models through a single interface. OpenRouter acts as a "router" or
  gateway that lets developers and applications access dozens of different AI
  models from various providers through one standardized API, rather than having
  to integrate with each provider separately.
